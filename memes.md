You can't have scientific equations without quantitative data. What distinct measurable properties do memes have?

Meme strength (S): Describes the intrinsic property a meme has concerning how fast it propagates.
----A meme with a high rate of transmission takes a short time to convert a majority of a population to meme vectors, but is not necessarily a meme that benefits the population.

----Can be measured by the number of hashtags over time on twitter.

----Can be measured by the number of unique pageviews with an appropriately long viewtime over time.

----Can be measured by using quizzes and surveys to find the percentage of a population that can reproduce the meme, over time.

----Can be measured by tagging a picture or movie with a "meme id" and finding how many times it was viewed.

----Can be broken down into three components:

--------Meme usefulness (U): Describes how much the meme benefits a specific population. 

------------Can be determined after meme strength and complexity are known.

--------Meme complexity (C): Describes how much internal resistance to meme production is there within the meme information itself.

------------Can be measured by the average number of n-grams required for transmission of meme to new meme vector.

------------Can be measured by position in universal semantic taxonomy.

------------Can be measured by the average time it takes for sample vectors to learn the meme.

------------External resistance is a measure of the population the meme is unleashed upon.

--------Meme affinity (A): Remember, each population is distinct. Populations with competing or antagonistic memes will have a negative rate modifier. Memeplexed memes can be described with a rate modifier. For example a population that is more accepting of technology will be more receptive to "video game" memes. This affinity for certain memes is an optional term.

------------Not sure if the affinity term would only be for the meme strength term or also for the meme substrate term or both. They might even need separate terms.

The equation describing meme strength will look something like this: S=U/C+A

----A very useful meme will be very strong, while a very complex one will be much weaker. Certain populations may be more resistant to particular memes and this would require an affinity term to correct for. The meme's strength is higher if there's a population affinity for the meme or lower if there is a negative affinity.
