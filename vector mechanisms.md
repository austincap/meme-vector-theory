Vector mechanisms: Different tools the vector uses to propagate it's meme. Spoken language or even pictures are oftentimes the mechanism. Memes vectors can use a combination of vector mechanisms creating an ensemble mechanism.
----Different mechanisms may provide different average rates of meme transfer, although information content is oftentimes more important. Initially to keep it simple, we will assume there is no variable that dictates mechanism rate until evidence inevitably proves otherwise. Experiments will have to be set up severely restricting the mechanisms accesible to a population. Once found, a variable V can be a part of the P term, modifying all population variables.
----Keep in mind different memes and populations will react differently to the same mechanism anyway.  The interplay between memes and the population are what we are describing. Solid data about memes and populations needs to be collected first before finding vector mechanisms.

Meme vector mechanisms examples:

----a hashtag

----written text

----neural implants that allow one to directly communicate with the brain of another similarly implanted person

----the net

----twitter specifically

----an individual account on twitter

----pictures

----movies

----gifs

----a theoretical rapid morse code that can be subconciously processed

----a car

----a single book

----a book printing run

--------I theorize that different vector mechanisms will have different rates of effectiveness eg: direct neural connection = 1, written text = .5, commercials = .1. These are made up values but would describe that telepathy has a vector mechanism rate of 100%, a written text rate of 50%, etc. Similarly, someone who does a 1000 book print run will have a higher effectiveness rate than a 100 book print run.

Memetics should be concerned primarily with the transfer of information, so how does information theory play into all this?

----Information communicated is done so via the vector mechanism. Ambiguous signals lead to poor meme transmission rate. Are pictures worth a thousand words? We can find the answer to this question once the equation is refined and lots of data is gathered.
