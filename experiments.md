How do we go about actually finding these constants I claim describe memes and populations?

- Basic analysis:

  1. Create and identify novel meme.
  2. Identify your vector population.
  3. Develop a test to determine whether or not a vector carries the meme.
  4. Take cross-sectional or longitudinal data over time. A simple tally of meme vectors.
  5. Fit the meme equation to your data.

Here's a step-by-step real-world example:

The goal of this experiment is to determine the population resistance of 5 populations.
1. 'Meme vector theory' is the meme being studied. This decentralized document is a thorough description of the meme.

2. The vector populations studied will be the: pod.diaspora.co.nz social network.

3. If a vector posts the '#memevector' hashtag, that is reasonably indicative of the the vector having the capability to propagate the meme; i.e. that they are a meme vector.

4. 11/7/2014 is the first day the meme seeds were planted.

5. WAITING ON DATA
 
- In order to fit the meme equation the meme strength of this meme is assumed to be 1 with no population affinity. All S values found in future research will be relative to this assumption.

  - Meme vector theory does not have to be the "identity meme" by any means. It might make more sense to use something else, although I'm not sure what.

- Repeat the experiment with additional populations to find additional values for P. Once a consistent value for the P of a single population is found, the S for other memes can be found using the known P. Once more S values are found, it will be easier to determine more P values, and so on.

NOTE: The same meme can not be studied twice on the same population even by a different researcher. Once a meme vector, always a meme vector. Accurate values for S and P can only be determined via repeated analysis. It is probably a good idea to study memes and populations in sets i.e. 3 populations and 5 memes. After using the "identity meme" to find values for P for each population, find each S using each P (i.e. find S for meme1, meme2, meme3, etc with population1 constant, then again with population2 constant, etc). After this, each S will have 3 values. The true value is the average. Finally, using this new average S value for each meme, fit the meme equation to your old data. This gives you 4 (1 meme is the identity meme) new P values for each population. The true value is the average.
