How do we go about actually finding these constants I claim describe memes and populations?

- There are going to be infinite possible ways to study memes these are just a few examples.

- Basic analysis:

  1. Create and identify novel meme.

  2. Identify your vector population.

  3. Develop a test to determine whether or not a vector carries the meme.

  4. Take cross-sectional or longitudinal data over time. A simple tally of meme vectors.

  5. Fit the meme equation to your data.

- Repeat basic analysis with different memes but the same population. Keep the P variable constant
