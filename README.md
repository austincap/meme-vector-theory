Theory: there is an useful mathematical way to describe how a meme behaves with respect to a population. This is done via a modified Hill equation. This theory also contributes the concepts of meme vectors and vector mechanisms to memetics.

What is the use of this theory?

-Improved memetic engineering and in turn, increased control over the universe.

-Memetics has been criticized as pseudo-science because it had no empirical component. I seek to change that before the technology is cheap enough to give everyone fMRIs all the time.

-We need a way to quantitatively classify different memes. This information could be added to the existing dictionary of concepts. Think of it as the periodic table of ideas. Maybe the CRC or the dewey decimal system would be a more appropriate analogy?

-Some questions I personally hope to answer: How do story trope memes interact with different meme substrates to create cultural narratives? How do memes interact with each other or their environments and can we predict the results? What is the "formula" being used to produce our media? Can we evaluate what is "mainstream" empirically? Also, is there anything to "internet rule of thumbs" such as the "90:9:1 rule" and the "Wadsworth constant"?

-A more thorough understanding of information itself will be critical as data science and machine learning become a larger part of the economy. Memes are quanta of cultural information. I'd like to think artists can make use of research on the spread of memes as well.

-I'm just spitballing on this last one, but it might be the secret to unlocking how the fundamental units of information theory connect to the fundamental units of the brain. We cracked the genetic code. Is there a neuronal or memetic code? I spitball this will turn out to be tied to fundamental language modules in the human brain.

Science is not necessarily taken seriously as science initially. Plate tectonics was a joke for the first fifty years the theory existed. Computational neuroscience is the latest stage in evolution of Freud's hilarious ideas. The point is you gotta start somewhere.
