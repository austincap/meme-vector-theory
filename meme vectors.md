Meme vector: A dynamic, singular entity that is capable of reproducing a given a meme by creating more meme vectors. eg: people, twitter accounts, corporations, movie studios, dolphins, AI. 

----An artist (putting the meme on an infographic) or a celebrity's twitter account (making a tweet about the meme) are meme vectors. The tweet or infographic itself are not meme vectors but rather vector mechanisms, discussed in the vector mechanism section.

----"Dynamic" refers to the capability of the entity to produce new information. While a tweet or book are both singular entities capable of reproducing a given meme by creating new meme vectors, they are not capable of creating new memes. This is a necessary logical distinction to make. The number of people who purchased a book containing a meme is a more accurate measure of the meme saturation than merely the total number of books produced. The total number of hashtags for a particular meme being used is an accurate measure because for each hashtag to be created, a dynamic, singular twitter account had to consciously type it out (not counting bots).

----Each meme, meme vector, population, and vector mechanism needs to be formally defined prior to study.

----Meme vectors are created and are assumed to only decrease neglibily, although they may need to be re-tested. If measurable mutation has occurred in the meme, a new meme is created with a meme saturation of zero percent. The original meme continues propagating, but it's growth is likely to slow which can be described by the addition of an affinity modifier.

----"Uninfected" people are simply referred to as vectors. they become meme vectors once they are capable of reproducing the meme.

Vector population AKA meme substrate AKA meme environment: Every potential meme vector in some contained, studiable setting. eg: every user on twitter, all your facebook friends, a school, a country.

----This is not a meme pool. The memes themselves reside in the meme pool, the meme vectors reside in the meme vector population. If the memepool is like "sea of ideas" than the population is like the current.

----A subclass of this is the meme vector population, the percentage of the population "infected" with the meme.

----In the equation this is represented by a variable that estimates the collective effect every single meme vector and vector mechanism used has on the population; ie the overall nature of the community. This might be useful think of as an meme resistance factor.

Population variable AKA meme substrate term AKA meme resistance factor (P):

----Population resistance is described by an idea flow variable and likely by an ensemble vector mechanism variable plus an optional specific meme affinity variable. 

--------Idea flow (I): The relative ease with which information can be communicated. 

------------In absense of technology this would be related to physical proximity of each vector or physical size of the region the population resides in.

------------Related to speed and freedom of internet and the average intelligence of population.

------------Can be related to cultural values. Cultures open to new ideas would have a higher idea flow.

------------Not sure how this can be measured.

--------Ensemble vector mechanism (V): The aggregate value of the vector mechanisms used by vectors in the population

------------Vector mechanisms are a going to be orders of magnitude be more constant between different populations than memes will be and P describes the population well enough for our initial purposes so for now put a question mark next to this variable. Like this whole theory, it might not prove to be useful.

------------On twitter for instance speech is not an option, only text and pics.

------------Would incorporate facts like one vector published a book with the meme but everyone else in the population used speech. There is likely some sort of mathematic vector addition that would represent a few meme vectors using very strong mechanisms while most meme vectors use smaller ones.

------------Not sure how this can be measured either.

--------Population affinity (A): An optional term that describes how certain memes can change the resistance factor of a population. For example "hippy" memes make the entire infected population more receptive to new ideas.

------------Not sure if the affinity term would only be for the meme substrate term or also for the meme strength term or both. They might even need separate terms.

The equation describing meme substrate will look something like this: P=1/(I*V+A)

----A very meme-resistant population will have a poor idea flow and use inefficient vector mechanisms.
