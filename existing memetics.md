Perhaps a refresher on currently existing memetics is in order:

Meme: A unit of culture or an idea. This may be the most confusing of all the terms on this page as it has become synonmous in mainstream culture to pictures with words on them. If clarification is required, I will refer to that is an internet meme and a unit of culture as a dawkinian meme.

Meme pool: A population of memes in the abstract "thoughtsphere" AKA "cultural matrix." I think this term confuses people, hence my development of the more concrete, observable population of meme vectors.

Memetic algorithms: An AI approach that emulates the gist of cultural transmission. Not really related to the study of cultural transmission.

Memotype: Actual information content of meme. Includes position in universal semantic network and the neuronal constellation associated with the meme.

 ----Can be used as a unique identifier for memes and will be useful when finding memetic difference.
 
 ----Ideally as an average of the neuronal constellation activated when a meme is presented to large sample of subjects. Until that's practical, we can use the average meme strength among different populations along with complexity.
 
 ----I am proposing that the average number of n-grams used before a reproducible meme is created in another meme vector (ie: the amount of text one needs to learn a meme) can be used as an estimate of the memotype. Basically it's equivalent to approximating a genes identity based on its length.

Memeplex: A collection of memes that have a symbiotic or antagonistic nature. 

 ----In order to distinguish a memeplex from a meme a threshold in memotype difference needs to be met. This will be arbitrarily set until evidence gives reason to change it.

Memetics should concern the interplay between the various forces contained within the meme itself, the nature of the mechanisms used, and the population that are measured in meme adoption AKA meme saturation in the studied population. The analogy to genetics works on the surface but there are clearly different forces at play. For instance, there is no logical equivalent of alleles because memetics is lamarckian. Mutations to the memotype occur during its existence, not during reproduction.
